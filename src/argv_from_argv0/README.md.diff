-Argv from File Descriptor
-=========================
-Nearly the same as [`argv_from_stdin`](../argv_from_stdin) but an
-attempt will be made to read configuration a specific file descriptor number
-instead of standard input (i.e. file descriptor number 0).
+Argv from `argv[0]` 
+===================
+Nearly the same as [`argv_from_file_descriptor`](../argv_from_file_descriptor)
+but an attempt will be made to read configuration from `argv[0]` as if it had
+been read from the file descriptor.
 
-The file descriptor number is hardcoded to 7.

-File Descriptor
----------------
-The address and file as whitespace-separated words from file descriptor 7, and
-override the environment variables.  If only one word is read, it is taken to
+`argv[0]`
+---------
+The address and file as whitespace-separated words from `argv[0]`, and
+override the environment variables.  If only one word is found, it is taken to
 be the address.
 
+This is easiest to do with bash's `exec -a`.
+
 ### Examples
-Set the address and file via a heredoc:
+Set the address and file:
 ```sh
-./argv_from_file_descriptor 7<<_eof
-localhost:5555 /etc/passwd
-_eof
+bash -c 'exec -a "localhost:5555 /etc/passwd" ./argv_from_argv0'
 ```
 
-Set just the address via bash's Here String:
+Set neither, which looks a bit silly in a process listing:
 ```sh
-./bin/argv_from_file_descriptor 7<<<"localhost:5555"
+bash -c 'exec -a "" ./argv_from_argv0'
 ```

 `go build -ldflags '-X main.Foo=bar'`).  The variables are as follows
